# termchat

**⚠️ ARCHIVED PROJECT - FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY**

This repository contains an abandoned prototype of a peer-to-peer terminal chat application. Development was halted in the early stages due to fundamental limitations with SSH connectivity across the internet.

See [FINAL-BOTTLENECK.md](FINAL-BOTTLENECK.md) for details on why this project was discontinued.

The code is provided as-is for educational purposes or if someone wants to fork it for local network use cases.
