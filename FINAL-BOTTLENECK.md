# The SSH Bottleneck: Why I'm Pausing termchat Development

## The Vision vs Reality

I built termchat with a simple vision: "Google Meet but for the terminal" - a peer-to-peer chat that's as easy as sharing a link. The implementation works beautifully... if you're on the same network.

## The Fundamental Problem

Here's the reality I've hit: **SSH doesn't work the way sharing a link works**.

When you share a Google Meet link, anyone can join from anywhere. When you share a termchat session ID, the other person needs to be able to SSH into your machine. This is where everything breaks down:

1. **Home users** - Your router blocks incoming SSH connections. Your ISP might not even give you a real public IP (CGNAT).
2. **Corporate users** - Firewalls block SSH. IT policies prevent exposing machines.
3. **Mobile users** - No incoming connections at all.

## What Works vs What Doesn't

✅ **termchat works great for:**
- Developers on the same network
- People with access to a shared server
- Local testing and development
- University computer labs

❌ **termchat fails for:**
- Friend in another city wanting to chat
- Remote work colleagues behind different firewalls  
- Anyone on a typical home internet connection
- The "send a link to anyone" use case

## The Technical Reality

I originally chose SSH because:
- It's secure by default
- No server infrastructure needed
- Developers already have it

But SSH's strength (security through access control) is also its weakness here. SSH is designed to keep people OUT unless explicitly authorized. That's the opposite of what you want for easy link-sharing.

## Why I'm Not Continuing

To make termchat work like I envisioned, I'd need to either:

1. **Run relay servers** - Defeats the "no server" principle
2. **Implement NAT traversal** - Basically recreating WebRTC
3. **Use a different protocol** - Starting over from scratch
4. **Require users to set up port forwarding** - Too technical for most

Each solution moves away from the simple, serverless design that made termchat interesting in the first place.

## The Code is Yours

Despite this limitation, termchat is fully functional for local networks. If you find it useful, please:

- Fork it
- Improve it  
- Add relay support if you want
- Use it for your specific use case

The codebase is clean, well-tested, and performant. It does exactly what it says on the tin - P2P chat over SSH. The limitation isn't in the implementation, it's in the protocol choice.

## Lessons Learned

Building termchat taught me that sometimes the "simple" solution (just use SSH!) isn't simple for users. True peer-to-peer communication on today's internet is hard - there's a reason why even "P2P" apps like Zoom use relay servers.

If someone wants to take this further, consider:
- WebRTC data channels for true P2P with NAT traversal
- Optional relay mode for when direct connections fail
- Integration with overlay networks like Tailscale
- A hybrid approach: SSH for local, something else for internet

## Final Thoughts

termchat works perfectly for what it is: a serverless, P2P terminal chat for people who can SSH to each other. That's just a much smaller group than "anyone with the link."

Sometimes the best code is the code that knows its limitations.
